**HackerSushant76/HackerSushant76** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


-->
I am a student at Masai School . I have been learning MERN stack from last 6 months now. I have worked on many projects and done many commits in this period.
I worked everyday on assignments and some mini projects. After every month I have made a major project.

-My first project was a group project of 6 members , where I learned to work in a team. That project was about cloning a E-commerce website named as Beautybebo.com. My main contribution in this project is making the product pages, cart page and payment page as well.

-The Next project was also about cloning a E-commerce website, this time it is banggood.com. It was also completd in a team of six members.

-My third project was a individual project and Here I cloned a website named Everhour.com, It is time tracking website for working professionals and businesses. I think worked hardest in this project. Here we have to complete the project in just 4 days. I used React for this website.
